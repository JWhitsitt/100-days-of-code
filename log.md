# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created service.yaml and deployment.yaml files as part of Udacity's AWS nanodegree program. Working on a lesson to implement k8s on AWS using simple docker containers created in an earlier lesson.

**Thoughts:** As I understand it, Kubernetes is another layer of abstraction to automate continuous deployment. Application components -> docker images -> docker containers -> k8s pods -> k8s service

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
